    "\n",
    "Last week you created master dark and flat calibration frames and used them to fully reduce over two thousand science images. Now that these images are suited for scientific measurement, we are ready to perform aperture photometry. ** Note: if you were not able to succesfully reduce the science frames from last week, you need to finish that before beginning this lab. **\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't want you to labor unnecessarily over the details of measuring the aperture photometry, so we provide the code for the most complicated first steps below. We do want you to understand the measurements that are performed, and we need you to help with the filenames, so please carefully read and modify the cells below as you evaluate them. Like in the last lab, there are embedded questions highlighted <mark>like this</mark> that we ask you to respond to on the quiz associated with this lab on Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code will calculate aperture photometry for the science target and a comparison star for every image with a bunch of different aperture sizes. This returns a large numpy array that you will have to manipulate to decide which aperture size is optimal and to write out a final light curve for further analysis next week."

We tried to identify when that was happening and replace those values in the photometry array with np.nan, which stands for \"not a number,\" and is not displayed when plotted.  However, you may need to use special numpy features when characterizing slices of this array, like np.nanmin() instead of np.min, and np.nanmean instead of np.mean(), etc.\n",

To choose, plot the divided light curves (summed target flux / summed comparison star flux) for each aperture size. With the \"%matplotlib notebook\" command, you can use tools to zoom in and inspect plots in more detail; just remember to call the plt.figure() command before starting a new plot.\n",

Try to replace these with np.nan values by applying a cut on the data (using np.where() or loops and if statements).

The first column of this data file should contain the relative time of each frame (0,10,20,..., since this is a sequence of 10-second exposures), and the second column should contain the divided, normalized light curve after removing obvious outliers.  *DO NOT* include the nan values in the output, but be sure to account for them when constructing the \"time\" column.  np.savetxt() may be useful.\n",
